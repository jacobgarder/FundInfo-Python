To run the program you will need to download and install Python 3, this can be done at https://www.python.org/downloads/

Run the program by double-clicking on main.py. You will then be prompted to enter a path for the fundlist, e.g. example.list. 
The program will then download and display data for the fundlist, sorted after 3-month performance. 
Then you will get the option to only list the top n funds, where n is decided by you.
At the end the program will print some statistics about the US Unemployment rate.

The program can handle funds, stocks and ETF's from Avanza. You can find the id in the address for each fund/stock/ETF, 
e.g. https://www.avanza.se/fonder/om-fonden.html/1933/swedbank-robur-ny-teknik
